/*
Aim: To create a like button next to the names of each patient with a numerical representation of how many times the button was pressed.
What I would need:
- Create a new component[X]
    -within local state, I would need to have a counter attribute[X]
- Create click handler[X]
    - Within this click handler, I need counter to track (amount of times the button is clicked)[X]
